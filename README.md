# Rising Tide
A 2D survival game made C++ in 25 days with no libraries or engines.

Download the game:
https://github.com/Pere001/rising_tide_ld50_executable/blob/main/Rising%20Tide.rar

To compile (MSVC):
1. Run the compiler from your command-line, which should look something like this:
   call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x64
2. Call build.bat


Remarks:
- This is the first iteration of the game, but I will continue to improve it.
- The game was programmed as a prototype, with a focus on development speed, so the code is very simple and unoptimized.
- The image loading only accepts uncompressed bmp files.
- There is no sound, as I didn't have time to either program a mixer or create decent sounds.
