# Rising Tide
A 2D survival game made from scratch in C++ in 25 days.
Compiled with MSVC.

To compile:
1. Run the compiler from your command line, which should look something like this:
   call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x64
2. Call build.bat


Remarks:
- This is the first iteration of the game, but I will continue to improve it.
- The game was programmed as a prototype, with a focus on development speed, so the code is very simple and unoptimized.
- The image loading only accepts uncompressed bmp files.
- There is no sound, as I didn't have time to either program a mixer or create decent sounds.
